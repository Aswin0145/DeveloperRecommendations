## B101: assert_used ##

There are a few ways to address the vulnerability associated with the use of assert statements in Python code. Here are a few options:

- Remove assert statements from production code: This is the most straightforward solution, as it eliminates the vulnerability altogether. However, this can also make it harder to detect and diagnose bugs in the code.

- Use a command-line flag to disable asserts: You can use a command-line flag or an environment variable to disable assert statements in production code, while still leaving them in place for testing and development. This way, you can still use assert statements for debugging, but they won't be a vulnerability in production.

- Use a try-except block: Instead of using an assert statement to check for errors, you can use a try-except block to catch and handle any exceptions that are raised. This can be more robust and flexible than relying on assert statements alone.

- Use a logging mechanism: In place of an assert statement, you can use a logging mechanism to log the error and continue execution. This way the program doesn't stop the execution and continue with other code.

It's worth noting that the best approach will depend on the specific use case and requirements of your code. But a combination of these methods can be a good solution to address the vulnerability.
